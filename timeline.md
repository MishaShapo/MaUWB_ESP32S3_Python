# Project Updates


## July

### 2025-07-14
- Used ST Link programmer + STM32 Cube Programmer to update 2 modules to newest software
- Finally use the TS101 Soldering iron to solder on header pins for ST Link
- Will need to solder on header pins for the other modules and update them so that all modules are on the same firmware

### 2025-07-15
- Re-imaged 3 additional anchors with Circuit Python
- Played around a little with Web Workflow since it will be very helpful to updating code on 4 anchors without need to connec to USB
- ESP uses 2.4 Gz wifi tho so will need to mess with Wifi settings to get ESP and laptop on the same network
- Could also try the Bluetooth Workflow instead but IDK if that will force me to connect 1 ESP at a time. Would love to be able to open 4 tabs and connect to all 4 at once

### 2025-07-15 2
- Soldered ST Link pins for 5 remaining boards
- Upgraded MaUWB firmware on 5 boards
- Soldered another NodeMCU ESP32S3
- Re-soldered motoron motor controller to test later
- Read about this REALLY cool IOT management software called "ThingsBoard" and this project for OTA updates for the ESP with it:
