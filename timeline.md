# Project Updates


## July

### 2025-07-14
- Used ST Link programmer + STM32 Cube Programmer to update 2 modules to newest software
- Finally use the TS101 Soldering iron to solder on header pins for ST Link
- Will need to solder on header pins for the other modules and update them so that all modules are on the same firmware
